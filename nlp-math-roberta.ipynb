       " 'doc': 'American workers aren’t getting the compensation they deserve, in either time or money, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said at a recent Orlando debate. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, on April 25, 2016, Grayson said he supported a higher minimum wage. Providing more pay won’t hurt the businesses, he said, because other nations have higher wages with no ill effects. Furthermore, many countries also guarantee paid time off and their economies are fine, Grayson said. But not the United States. \"There\\'s only three countries in the entire world wherethere\\'s no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them. The other two are in Africa,\" he said. That stat stopped us cold, and not just because we’re overdue for a long weekend off. Could Grayson be right that the United States is one of the only countries in the entire world that doesn’t grant a legal right to paid time off? Well, not exactly; Grayson’s campaign admitted he had misspoken. But available research shows he’s not far off the mark by suggesting that America is unique by not guaranteeing vacation time. Zero guarantee Grayson campaign spokesman David Damron told us via email that the Orlando Democrat meant to say only a handful of island nations in the Pacific Ocean joined the United States in not guaranteeing paid time off — not two countries in Africa. Those five countries, according to Wikipedia, were Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and Nauru, he said. \"The congressman accidentally conflated guaranteed paid vacation and paid sick time in his recollection of which countries fell into this category of weak worker protections with the United States, which was the basis for his reference to Africa (rather than the Pacific),\" Damron wrote. We don’t take Wikipedia’s word as gospel, of course, but we could not get experts to speak to specific conditions in those five countries. Together, they have a population of around 300,000 — or about the population of Pittsburgh. The biggest repository of trusted data we found came from UCLA’s World Policy Analysis Center. Their database showed 13 countries, including the United States, with no guaranteed paid annual leave. Their list did include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru, but also larger countries like Pakistan and India. Now, sometimes leave varies by how long a worker is at a job or some other classification. The World Policy Analysis Center’s database notes they \"report the lowest amount of leave guaranteed to a worker with at least one year of tenure.\" The World Bank has its own detailed numbers for vacation available to workers based on tenure. The bank measured paid annual leave for 189 economies, including splitting some countries into large metro areas. The United States, for example, is split into New York and Los Angeles. The bank’s table did list five Pacific island nations that did not guarantee paid leave time for any workers with one or more years of service: The Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Palau and Tonga. It didn’t have data for Nauru, where unemployment among its 10,000 or so residents hovered around 90 percent in 2004. If it sounds to you like those aren’t the kind of countries normally associated with a global economic powerhouse like the United States, you’d be right. Most studies on this issue stuck to smaller sets of much more comparable nations. These usually involved grouping countries with words like \"developed\" or \"rich.\" For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries, notes that in 2014 the United States was its only member country with no statutory minimum of paid days off. A 2011 Business Insider roundup using data from global human resources firm Mercer said 39 developed countries offered more vacation time than the United States. Mercer’s Worldwide Benefit and Employment Guidelines, last updated in 2015, tracks 74 countries across the planet (the Pacific island nations Damron cited are absent). It notes the United States ranks the lowest among the surveyed countries with no \"statutory holiday entitlement.\" Often cited in media reports is the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s 2013 study, No-Vacation Nation Revisited. That paper compared paid vacation and paid holidays in 21 countries with advanced economies: 16 in Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. France led the pack with 30 paid vacation days. While the French get one paid holiday, Austrians get 13, plus 25 vacation days. The United Kingdom offers 28 vacation days. But almost every country in the CEPR study had more than 20 paid vacation days, except Canada and Japan, which only awarded 10. America came in dead last in guaranteed time off, with a grand total of zero days. Many employers do offer paid vacation and holidays, but there’s no law that says they must. And businesses do take advantage of the fact. \"In the absence of a legal requirement for paid vacation and paid holidays, about one fourth of the U.S. workforce has no paid vacation or paid holidays in the course of their work year,\" the CEPR report read. \"The sum of the average paid vacation and paid holidays ― 16 in total ― offered in the private sector in the United States would not meet even the minimum required by law in 19 other rich countries analyzed here.\" Our ruling Grayson said, \"There\\'s only three countries in the entire world wherethere\\'s no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them.\" Grayson’s claim, taken literally, is incorrect. A Grayson spokesman said the congressman had fumbled his talking point a bit, especially the part about a pair of African nations being the other two. But the point he was trying to make to viewers and voters largely holds up. The United States is certainly one of just a few countries that does not guarantee paid vacation as a right, and an outlier among developed nations. In that sense, Grayson’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.',\n",

       " 'claim': 'Social media posts with pictures of gas prices and captions urging people to “Never forget January 6th” accurately documented the cost of fuel on the day of the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot.',\n",
       " 'doc': 'The gas prices pictured in two different shared pictures did not reflect the national average price for regular unleaded gasoline on Jan. 6, 2021. Further, reverse image searches found that both photographs were taken while former U.S. President Barack Obama was in his second term in the White House. On June 12, 2022, the Cullman Daily Facebook page, which is managed by a self-described “conservative and Christian news organization,” posted a picture of an Exxon gas station sign showing the price for regular unleaded fuel at $1.73 per gallon, with the caption, “We will never forget January 6th, 2021.” At the time that post was published, U.S. gas prices had just reached a record high of $5 a gallon. The “Never forget January 6th” Facebook post was created when a U.S. House panel was conducting televised hearings to lay out evidence about events leading up to the day of the U.S. Capitol riot. On that day, Jan. 6, 2021, 140 law enforcement officers were injured as a result of the actions of a mob of supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who lost the 2020 U.S. presidential election. According to CNBC,Capitol Police OfficerBrian Sicknickdied the day after the riot, and at least four other officers later died by suicide. As for the accuracy of the “Never forget January 6th” Facebook post, in reality, the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline on Jan. 6, 2021, was between $2.25 and $2.31, not $1.73, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Further, the photograph in the post was captured in Woodbridge, Virginia on Jan. 5, 2016, five years before the violence at the Capitol. At the time, former U.S. President Barack Obama was serving his second elected term in the White House. Future U.S. President Joe Biden was Obama’s vice president for both terms. (EIA numbers showed that the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline in early January 2016 was around $2.02 per gallon.) We also found that a second picture of gas prices was used to promote a “Never forget January 6th” message, again in reference to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The photograph in these posts was shared on Facebook and Twitter in June 2022: Never forget January 6th, 2021 pic.twitter.com/8J9Zmz6jcN However, again, this picture was somewhat misleading, both because of the prices displayed on the sign and the origins of the photograph. The picture was captured at a Citgo gas station in January 2015, also when Obama was president and Biden was vice president. (In January 2015, the national average for regular unleaded gasoline ranged between $2.04 and $2.21 per gallon.) In early 2020, when Trump still occupied the White House, gas prices fell due to a dramatic decrease in demand for gasoline following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Basically, fewer drivers on the road meant less gasoline purchased, which drove down costs. More than two years later, when U.S. President Joe Biden was in his second year in the White House, gas prices reached the aforementioned record high national average of $5 per gallon. The Associated Press reported that a variety of non-political factors were believed to have contributed to higher gas prices not just in the U.S., but around the world: Global oil prices have been rising — unevenly, but sharply overall — since December. The price of international crude has roughly doubled in that time, with the U.S. benchmark rising nearly as much … Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by the United States and its allies have contributed to the rise. Russia is a leading oil producer. The United States is the world’s largest oil producer, but U.S. capacity to turn oil into gasoline is down 900,000 barrels of oil per day since the end of 2019, according to the Energy Department. Tighter oil and gasoline supplies are hitting as energy consumption rises because of the economic recovery. The reporting also mentioned that the record high was likely reached in part due to demand for gasoline for all of the travelers who hit the road around the Memorial Day holiday. In sum, two pictures were making the rounds on social media with captions that read, “Never Forget January 6th.” Neither photograph accurately represented the national average gas price on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the Capitol riot. In fact, both pictures were captured years before, while Obama was president and Biden was vice president. Note: As of June 2022,more than 800 peoplehad been arrested for their alleged participation in the violent Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

       " 'claim': 'Says Donald Trump’s tax plan gives the wealthy and corporations \"more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.\"',\n",
       " 'doc': 'With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate. When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most. \"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two,\" Clinton said. \"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.\" Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump’s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts? The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP. The evidence shows Clinton is right. The Bush tax cuts As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003, reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year). Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.) Trump’s plan Trump’s plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation,and delivera tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Two key provisions in Trump’s latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check. First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.) Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently \"pass through\" the business and instead are taxed as their owner\\'s ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders. In its analysis of Trump’s tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan’s impact on individual taxpayers. The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here’s a table breaking down Trump’s proposed tax cuts by income group: Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. The think tank also said the Trump’s cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump. The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break. Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years. While Trump’s plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he’s proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent — an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted. Our ruling Clinton said Trump’s tax plan will give the wealthy \"more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.\" After-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 5.4 to 6.7 percent thanks to the Bush tax cuts. The same group would see incomes gains of 10.2 to 19.9 percent under the Trump tax plan, if not more. Measuring it in a different way, the top 1 percent received a tax break equivalent to 0.66 percent of GDP under Bush. Trump’s tax plan would deliver a cut equivalent to 1.32 percent of GDP.

(see chart.) the presidents budget tries to obscure this massive income shift by not accounting for the vast majority of the tax cuts costs. but his priorities remain clear: tax-cut windfalls for the wealthy and corporations, and huge cuts in health, food, job training, and other basic aid, producing greater hardship for struggling families.',\n",

have undergone a gradual adjustment since he took office. there has been a 94 percent increase in the price of gasoline over the first three years of the obama presidency. in the name of clean energy, president obamas policies systematically inflate u.s. gas prices and lighten american wallets and pocketbooks:[Evidence]:how are fuel prices affecting companies? the surge in gasoline prices is impossible to miss and at the top of consumers\\' minds as billboards announce that gas now costs $4, or $5, or even above $6 a gallon in some places. with prices at record highs, americans are feeling the impact at the pump immediately. but higher fuel prices are a headwind for the wider economy too, beyond just consumers having less spending money. the rising cost of fuel, especially diesel, means that anything transported on a truck, train or ship is affected. energy costs are a major contributor to the decades-high inflation numbers showing up, as prices for all manner of goods and services march higher. \"energy, in a way, is the tail wagging the dog here,\" bob mcnally, president at rapidan energy group, said wednesday on cnbc\\'s \"power lunch.\" \"diesel is really the economic fuel. it\\'s the lifeblood of the economy, transportation, power in some cases ... so it really is embedded in economic activity and it\\'s filtered through so many goods and services.\" demand destruction, or the level at which high prices influence consumer behavior, from surging fuel costs might not have set in yet on a wide scale, but the impacts are filtering throughout the economy. higher prices at the pump mean not only less spending money in consumers\\' pockets but also expanding costs for companies, some or all of which will later be passed along to consumers. target is one of the companies grappling with higher costs. shares of the store chain cratered 25% on wednesday  the single worst day since 1987  following target\\'s earnings results, during which it warned about inflationary pressures. \"we did not anticipate the rapid shifts we\\'ve seen over the last 60 days. we did not anticipate that transportation and freight costs would soar the way they have as fuel prices have risen to all-time highs,\" target ceo brian cornell said wednesday on the company\\'s quarterly earnings call. he told cnbc that higher fuel and diesel costs will be a roughly $1 billion incremental cost during the fiscal year and a \"significant increase that [target] didn\\'t anticipate.\"[Evidence]:18 janv. 2021  ... capitol for possible \"reconnaissance\" the day before

for the wealthy and corporations in exchange for continuing important tax benefits for working families.12 but this has gone far enough. further tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations do not belong in measures to improve the tax code for working families, because these tax cuts will undermine vital programs for working families. anyone can clearly see whether proposed legislation would cut taxes for the wealthy or corporations, thanks to high-quality, nonpartisan analysis from the independent tax policy center and the legislative branchs joint committee on taxation. trickle-down tax cuts have repeatedly failed to produce broad-based economic growth. a significant majority of americans not only oppose such tax cuts but would support higher taxes on the wealthy and big corporations.[Evidence]:the united states imposes a tax on the profits of us resident corporations at a rate of 21 percent (reduced from 35 percent by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs ...[Evidence]:the

annually from just these two provisions (assuming they have similar income levels and income sources as in 2014). this estimate likely significantly understates the tax cuts for the top 400 because it covers only two provisions that represent about one-third of the trump tax plans overall cost. the estimate omits various costly, top-tilted proposals that would benefit the top 400, including cutting the corporate tax rate by more than half (from 35 to 15 percent), cutting the top rate on wages and salaries by nearly five percentage points (from 39.6 to 35 percent), and repealing the estate tax on inherited wealth (which only affects the wealthiest 2 out of every 1,000 estates).[8] these further tax cuts would likely dwarf any effects from the few offsets the plan identifies, including eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes. president trumps tax plan contains specific, costly tax cuts for the wealthy and profitable corporations but only vague promises for working families.[1] even accounting for his proposal to restrict most itemized deductions, the top 1 percent would still receive annual tax cuts averaging at least $250,000 per household. but the tax cuts at the very top would be far larger. their annual tax cuts would be more than five times the typical college graduates lifetime earnings.the 400 highest-income taxpayers  whose incomes average more than $300 million a year  would get average tax cuts of at least $15 million a year each, we estimate from irs data. their annual tax cuts would be more than five times the typical college graduates lifetime earnings.[2] (see figure 1.) the total tax cut for these 400 households would be at least $6 billion annually. our estimates are based on the tax cuts that the top 400 would receive from just two provisions of the trump plan: reducing to 15 percent the tax rate on pass-through business income (income from businesses such as partnerships, s corporations, and sole proprietorships that is claimed on individual tax returns and is taxed at the same rates as wages and salaries) and repealing the 3.8 percent medicare tax on unearned income that high-income households receive.[Evidence]:29

while their profits have soared, their investment in the economy did not. their shareholders and top executives reaped the benefits, without the promised trickle down to workers, consumers, or communities. the budget would set the corporate tax rate at 28 percent, still well below the 35 percent rate that prevailed prior to the 2017 tax law. this tax rate change is complemented by other

be clear: the wealthiest americans and big corporations do not need any more tax cuts. some broad-based tax cuts also benefit the wealthiest americans, which means that these proposals would need to be adjusted to pass the test of not providing tax cuts for the wealthy. increasing the standard deduction, for example, would reduce taxes for low- and middle-income households, but this would also reduce taxes for wealthy households. in order to prevent a needless tax giveaway for the wealthy, a bill that increases the standard deduction would need to be limited to those households in lower tax brackets or include a revenue-raising measure to offset the benefit to the top 1 percent. tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations have repeatedly failed to grow the economy, and the american people strongly oppose this trickle-down agenda. after an election in which voters rejected elites of both political parties, members of congress should take a stand against any policy that further enriches wealthy and corporate interests. lawmakers should make clear that tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations are off the tableand get to work on the negotiations and compromise that will be necessary to make the tax code work better for average americans.[Evidence]:congressional republicans are calling for extending expiring provisions of the trump tax cuts and repealing inflation reduction act

time, the president proposes roughly $6 trillion in tax cuts (from his tax plan and from the house-passed bill, which he has endorsed, to repeal the affordable care act) over the next decade. theyre so skewed to the top that the tiny fraction of households with annual incomes above $1 million would get more than $2 trillion in tax cuts. in other words, millionaires would gain trillions from the trump plan. as weve detailed, the trump tax plan has little to offer low- and moderate-income families but many tax cuts that are heavily tilted to the wealthy and corporations  and no credible way to offset their cost. they include slashing the top corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, which would mainly benefit wealthy investors, and repealing the estate tax, which would only benefit the heirs of the wealthiest 2 out of every 1,000 estates in the country. those two tax cuts alone would cost $2.5 trillion  essentially the same as the cut in low-and moderate-income programs. (see chart.) the presidents budget tries to obscure this massive income shift by not accounting for the vast majority of the tax cuts costs. but his priorities remain clear: tax-cut windfalls for the wealthy and corporations, and huge cuts in health, food, job training, and other basic aid, producing greater hardship for struggling families.[Evidence]:that means most middle-income and

reagan administration to claw back close to half the revenue loss,11 the equivalent of $10 trillion of the president\\'s 1981 tax cut remained. the george w. bush administration, empowered by a trifecta in 2001, enacted sweeping tax cuts that will have cost more than $8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023. the tax cuts lowered personal income tax rates across the board, both for labor income and for capital gains, and they significantly increased the untaxed portion of estates and lowered the estate tax rate. these changes were enormously tilted toward the rich and wealthy.23 while these increases were paired with an expansion of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, the total package gave significantly greater savings to the wealthy and also made the u.s. tax code significantly more regressive.24 in 2013, a significant majority of the bush tax cuts were made permanent with bipartisan support, locking in lower tax rates and deep cuts to the estate tax.25 these changes led to a significantly more regressive tax code than existed before the bush tax cuts were enacted, and one that brought in vastly less revenue.[Evidence]:claims that corporations are

congress failed to limit or eliminate enough tax expenditures to offset the costs of the proposed tax cuts. because these very high-income taxpayers would pay less than they do today in either scenario, the average net impact of ryans plan on some taxpayers at lower income levels would necessarily be a tax increase in order to fulfill ryans goal of collecting the same amount of revenue as

abortion is one of the most effective variables in population growth, adding that \"only three percent of abortions [in iran] are legal, and two percent of abortions are spontaneous.\"[Evidence]:the regulation of abortion may vary widely from country to country, but nearly all nations  96%  allow women to terminate their pregnancies in order to save their lives, according to a new pew research center analysis of 196 countries based on 2013 united nations data. indeed, only six countries do not allow women to receive abortions under any circumstances. about a quarter of the countries in the analysis (50 countries, or 26%) only allow abortions to save the life of the mother. an additional 82 nations (42%) allow abortions when the mothers life is at risk as well as for at least one other specific reason, such as to preserve a womans physical or mental health, in cases of rape or incest, because of fetal impairment or for social or economic reasons. and three-in-ten countries (58) allow abortions on request or for any reason, although many of these states do not allow women to terminate their pregnancies after a certain point (e.g., 20 weeks). although all countries in the middle east-north africa region allow abortions if the mothers life is at risk, only four out of 18 permit abortions in cases of rape or incest, and just two (bahrain and tunisia) allow abortion for any reason. similar trends are seen in sub-saharan africa, where 98% of countries allow abortions to save the mothers life, but only 33% permit abortion in cases of rape or incest and just two, cape verde and south africa, allow elective abortions for any reason. (percentages for sub-saharan africa could be slightly higher, but u.n. figures for south sudan were unavailable.)[Evidence]:16 gen 2013  while the episcopal church recognizes a woman's right to

women facing early, undesired pregnancies increased the probability of their entering college by 41 percent and completing college by 71 percent.7 these positive effects were particularly pronounced for black women experiencing early pregnancies: access to abortion increased their probability of entering college by up to 200 percent.8 abortion legalization has also boosted womens earnings: women whose abortion care allowed them to delay an unplanned start to parenthood by one year saw an 11 percent increase in hourly wages later on in their careers.9 given that many women are their families sole or primary breadwinner,10 and that access to abortion has had positive impacts on womens economic security overall, it is unsurprising that abortion legalization also lowered the chances of a child living in poverty.11 one 1997 study found that the so-called marginal child who was not born due to abortion accessand who would have been born absent abortion legalizationwould have been 40 percent more likely than the average u.s. child at the time to live in poverty.12 harms to women and families economic security under abortion bans research makes clear that when women do not have access to abortion care, they are more likely to suffer financially. led by an interdisciplinary team, the turnaway study tracked two groups of women: one composed of those who had received abortion care, and the other composed of women who had been denied care.13 the study determined that women who were forced to carry a pregnancy to term experienced a wide range of negative financial consequences, including lower credit scores, increased debt, and more negative public financial records such as bankruptcies and evictions.14 in addition to the impact on women themselves, the study showed that these restrictions are associated with worse child developmental outcomes and a greater likelihood of child poverty.15 additional studies have found that laws restricting access to abortion widened the gender pay gap for women of childbearing age by pushing them out of the labor force and into lower-paying jobs.16 in fact, one study found that abortion restrictions led to a drop of between 5 percent and 6.5 percent in average monthly salaries of women of childbearing age compared with the rest of the population.17 these decreases only compound the harms of the already unacceptable gender wage gap that hobbles womens earnings and long-term wealth.18 in 2020, women overall were paid just 73 cents for every dollar men earned.19 disparities were even greater for many women of color when compared with white, non-hispanic men:20 black women were paid just 58 cents, and latina women were paid just 49 cents.21 harms to state and local economies under abortion bans the institute for womens policy research found in 2021 that restrictive abortion laws cost state and local economies $105 billion annually by reducing labor force participation and earnings levels while also increasing time off and turnover among women ages 15 to 44 years old.22 the reasons behind these costs are clear: when women lack access to necessary benefits and support to balance work and familysuch as paid family and medical leave and workplace flexibilityand face increased caregiving responsibilities, they are forced to cut back on work hours or leave the workforce entirely. such costs will only worsen in a post-roe world as abortion is banned in many more states. state and local economies in states with abortion bans will also stand to lose even more money in a post-roe world, as some employers will relocate to states with abortion protections to attract and retain top talent and fulfill their public pledges of diversity and inclusion. for example, after indiana gov. eric holcomb (r) signed the states near-total abortion ban into law in august 2022, the pharmaceutical company eli lillyone of indianas largest employersissued a statement saying that it will be forced to plan for more employment growth out of [its] home state.23 state officials will harm women living in states with abortion bans, particularly those without means, who will face fewer job opportunities in their home state if they are unable or do not want to move when their employers understandably might relocate to another state.[Evidence]:16 giu 2018  \"let's not forget about tim

cannot be generalized as abortion, particularly because many women with ectopic pregnancies planned to conceive and wanted to carry their pregnancies to term.[Evidence]:22 lug 2023  thousands of

laws.[Evidence]:finally, in the background section, the authors state that in a 2013 study they all coauthored, the five researchers analyzed the same data from the same fifteen thousand patients to identify factors that increased the likelihood of women choosing to view an ultrasound image before an abortion. the authors found that women who identified as nonwhite, younger than twenty-five years of age, were at or below the federal poverty level, and who had medium or low levels of certainty about their decision to have an abortion were more likely to choose to view an ultrasound image. they found that overall, women chose to view the ultrasound image 42.5 percent of the time. overall, the authors record that 98.8 percent of pregnancies in the study ended in abortion. among women who chose to view the ultrasound image, 98.4 percent of pregnancies ended in abortion, and among women who did not view the image, 99 percent of pregnancies ended in abortion. the authors also sorted the data based on level of decision certainty, in addition to whether the women chose to view or not to view the ultrasound image. among women who chose not to view the image of the fetus, rates of abortion did not vary between women with different decision certainty levels. among women who did choose to view the image of the fetus, rates of abortion were slightly lower among women with medium or low decision certainty compared to women with high decision certainty. for women with high decision certainty, whether they chose to view or not view the ultrasound image made little difference. in \"discussion,\" the authors discuss the implications of their findings. most of the over fifteen thousand women in the study had high decision certainty and viewing the ultrasound image had no effect on their decision to have an abortion. unlike the two previous studies which found that ultrasound viewing had no effect on the decision, \"ultrasound viewing\" found that voluntarily viewing the ultrasound image had a very small effect on the seven percent of women with medium or low decision certainty.[Evidence]:the law permits physicians to terminate the lives of newborn infants and to

unvaccinated counterparts, according to a trio of new us studies. and in response to a letter yesterday in nejm, a separate group of cdc researchers updated its analysis of 2,456 pregnant women who

federal protections to women seeking to terminate their pregnancies, according to one analysis.[Evidence]:without coverage for abortion under medicaid, women must pay out-of-pocket for the procedure. costs vary by location, facility, and gestational age, but on average in 2014 an abortion cost between $500 at 10 weeks gestation, while at 20 weeks gestation, costs soared to $1195 or more. abortion costs are higher in states with more restrictive policies. women covered by medicaid in states that use state funds to pay for abortion have no out of pocket costs for abortion. though the vast majority (~90%) of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, the costs are challenging for many low-income women. the turnaway study found that women who received an abortion at any gestational age faced logistical barriers including difficulty finding a provider, and raising funds for the procedure and travel, but these barriers were more common and had greater consequences for women seeking an abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation. it is more difficult to find a provider for an abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation, and the procedure is more expensive. approximately 5% of abortions are performed at 16 weeks or later in the pregnancy. for women with medically complicated health situations or who need a second-trimester abortion, the costs could be prohibitive. in some cases, women find they have to delay their abortion while they take time to raise funds or in other cases, women are not able to obtain abortions because they cannot afford the costs of the procedure. furthermore, women who first learn of a fetal anomaly in the second trimester when the costs are considerably higher can face significant costs if they seek to terminate a pregnancy that may not be viable. according to the federal reserve board, 40% of u.s. adults do not have enough savings to pay for a $400 emergency expense.[Evidence]:the guttmacher institute estimates that approximately 58,030 abortions took place in texas during 2020. this number includes abortions performed on out-of-state residents but does not include abortions performed on texas residents in other states. the table below compares texas abortion totals by selected year. in 2020, an estimated 13.7% of pregnancies in texas ended in abortion. this number does not take into account miscarriages. it was arrived at by dividing guttmacher's abortion estimate by the sum total of live birthsas reported by the cdcand estimated abortions. the guttmacher institute estimates that the 2020 abortion rate for texas was 9.5. the 2020 abortion rate across the entire united states was 14.4. the table below compares texas abortion rates by selected year.[Evidence]:15 mai 2023  meanwhile, as the video went

globally, with nearly 50 countries including mexico, argentina, new zealand, thailand, and ireland liberalizing their abortion laws. during the same period, however, a few countries have made abortion more restricted or totally illegal, including el salvador, nicaragua, and poland. the u.s. legalized abortion nearly 50 years ago, at a time when it was legally restricted in many countries around the world, setting an important international precedent and example. it disappoints me to see that while important progress has been made towards equality in other culturally polarized areas such as same-sex marriage, womens right to terminate an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy is now severely threatened. if the supreme court were to limit or overturn roe, abortion would remain legal in 21 states

guttmacher institute estimates that approximately 20,990 abortions took place in ohio during 2020. this number includes abortions performed on out-of-state residents but does not include abortions performed on ohio residents in other states. the table below compares ohio abortion totals by selected year. in 2020, an estimated 14.0% of pregnancies in ohio ended in abortion. this number does not take into account miscarriages. it was arrived at by dividing guttmacher's abortion estimate by the sum total of live birthsas reported by the cdcand estimated abortions. in 2017, the guttmacher institute reports that there were 9 abortion clinics in ohio and 14 facilities that performed abortion. the table below compares total ohio abortion facilities by selected year.[Evidence]:2021-10-18

ten states that restrict abortion coverage have no option for obtaining abortion coverage. riders are not available on the individual market in these states. women enrolled in their fully-insured employer group plan are dependent on insurance companies offering riders in the group market and their employer choosing to purchase the rider. we found only one case of an employer that requested and purchased an abortion rider for their hsa hmo plan in 2017, and one insurance company offering two abortion riders in the kentucky small group market in 2018. as a result, the laws and policies that prohibit abortion coverage but permit riders are, in essence, bans on coverage because abortion riders are virtually nonexistent. how much does abortion coverage cost insurers? for insurers, the additional cost to provide abortion coverage as a benefit in a standard health policy is minimal. the actual cost of an abortion benefit for plans operating on the aca exchanges (where payments for abortion coverage are required to be segregated from the other services) was estimated to add between 11 and 33 cents per member per month (pmpm) in 2012, significantly less than the minimal additional premium charge for abortion coverage that is required by law, $1 pmpm. insurers that include abortion coverage pay for abortion services for their policy holders, but the additional cost is minimal because it is spread over all enrollees. it is impossible for women to anticipate they will need coverage for abortion services. half of pregnancies in the united states are unintended. women who seek an abortion may have had an unplanned pregnancy, been a victim of rape or incest, or they may have discovered a fetal anomaly where the fetus would not survive outside the womb, or experience a health problem that can make pregnancy unsustainable. in most states, laws banning abortion coverage in private insurance have exceptions in certain circumstances, but most are significantly narrower than the federal standard set by the hyde amendment (table 1). although all the state laws include an exception for life endangerment of the woman, nine out of the eleven states that restrict private insurance coverage of abortion do not include an exception for rape or incest. two states include exceptions in very limited circumstances beyond those set out by the hyde amendment: utah allows for coverage in the case of a lethal fetal anomaly, and michigan allows for coverage if the abortion is necessary to increase the probability of a live birth, to preserve the life or health of the child after live birth, (i.e. a fetal reduction in the cases of multiple pregnancy). in all other cases, abortion cannot be a covered service.[Evidence]:students in the usa took part in a protest

decision. so whats the harm in a law that requires an ultrasound if it will not change the minds of women who are certain but will give more information to women who are on the fence? but a new study published this month in the journal obstetrics & gynecology debunks that theory. women who were already certain that they wanted to get an abortion went through with the procedure even after seeing an ultrasound. this study lends more credence to the idea that women who are certain that an abortion is the right choice for them are not going to change their mind, and putting these women through the process of an ultrasound is an undue physical and emotional burden as the supreme court has indicated in its rulings so far. but with a renewed focus on abortion in the house this year, the debate is far from over.[Evidence]:sep 30, 2022  as iranian women burned their hijabs in protest at the country's repressive laws you might have heard people contrasting this to the french ...[Evidence]:is a

coverage if the hyde restrictions were lifted? because medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, states can choose to pay for abortions under medicaid in other instances, but must use their own revenues, and not federal funds, to cover the service. currently, 16 states have a policy directing the use of their own funds to pay for abortions for low-income women insured by medicaid beyond the hyde limitations, nine of which provide coverage as the result of a court order (figure 1). the arizona medicaid program, however, does not pay for abortions outside of circumstances permitted by hyde despite court orders directing them to do so. without coverage for abortion under medicaid, women must pay out-of-pocket for the procedure. costs vary by location, facility, and gestational age, but on average in 2014 an abortion cost between $500 at 10 weeks gestation, while at 20 weeks gestation, costs soared to $1195 or more. abortion costs are higher in states with more restrictive policies. women covered by medicaid in states that use state funds to pay for abortion have no out of pocket costs for abortion. though the vast majority (~90%) of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, the costs are challenging for many low-income women. the turnaway study found that women who received an abortion at any gestational age faced logistical barriers including difficulty finding a provider, and raising funds for the procedure and travel, but these barriers were more common and had greater consequences for women seeking an abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation. it is more difficult to find a provider for an abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation, and the procedure is more expensive. approximately 5% of abortions are performed at 16 weeks or later in the pregnancy. for women with medically complicated health situations or who need a second-trimester abortion, the costs could be prohibitive. in some cases, women find they have to delay their abortion while they take time to raise funds or in other cases, women are not able to obtain abortions because they cannot afford the costs of the procedure. furthermore, women who first learn of a fetal anomaly in the second trimester when the costs are considerably higher can face significant costs if they seek to terminate a pregnancy that may not be viable. according to the federal reserve board, 40% of u.s. adults do not have enough savings to pay for a $400 emergency expense.[Evidence]:pregnancy rates for women in the united states continued to decline in 2009, reaching the lowest level in 12 years (102.1 per 1,000 women aged 1544). this level is 12% below the 1990 peak (115.8) (1,2). the estimated number of pregnancies dropped to 6,369,000 (4,131,000 live births, 1,152,000 induced abortions, and 1,087,000 fetal losses). the drop in birth rates since 2007 has been well documented. however, it is important to examine the other outcomes of pregnancy to understand the full scope of current reproductive trends. the data in this report provide a comprehensive picture of pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes. data on pregnancy outcomes by age, race and hispanic origin, and marital status are presented using data from the national vital statistics system, the abortion surveillance system and guttmacher institute, and the national survey of family growth (nsfg). pregnancy rate: the number of pregnancies (including births, induced abortions, and fetal losses) per 1,000 women in a specified age or race and hispanic origin

pregnancy can be associated with severe maternal morbidity.1 in the united states, 1 covid-19 vaccine has been approved and 2 have been authorized for use for pregnant women. to date, data on maternal covid-19 vaccine safety come primarily from passive surveillance, and studies lack an unvaccinated comparison group.2,3 spontaneous abortion has been identified as a priority outcome in studies of maternal vaccine safety,4 and concerns regarding risks of spontaneous abortion may be a barrier to vaccination during pregnancy. we present findings from case-control surveillance of covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. of 105 446 unique pregnancies, 13 160 spontaneous abortions and 92 286 ongoing pregnancies were identified. overall, 7.8% of women received 1 or more bnt162b2 (pfizer-biontech) vaccines; 6.0% received 1 or more mrna-1273 (moderna) vaccines; and 0.5% received an ad26.cov.2.s (janssen) vaccine during pregnancy and before 20 weeks gestation. the proportion of women aged 35 through 49 years with spontaneous abortions was higher (38.7%) than with ongoing pregnancies (22.3%). a covid-19 vaccine was received within 28 days prior to an index date among 8.0% of ongoing pregnancy periods vs 8.6% of spontaneous abortions (table 1). spontaneous abortions did not have an increased odds of exposure to a covid-19 vaccination in the prior 28 days compared with ongoing pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio, 1.02; 95% ci, 0.96-1.08). results were consistent for mrna-1273 and bnt162b2 and by gestational age group (table 2).\n",
