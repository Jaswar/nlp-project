       " 'claim': '\"There\\'s only three countries in the entire world wherethere\\'s no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them.\"',\n",
       " 'doc': 'American workers aren’t getting the compensation they deserve, in either time or money, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said at a recent Orlando debate. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, on April 25, 2016, Grayson said he supported a higher minimum wage. Providing more pay won’t hurt the businesses, he said, because other nations have higher wages with no ill effects. Furthermore, many countries also guarantee paid time off and their economies are fine, Grayson said. But not the United States. \"There\\'s only three countries in the entire world wherethere\\'s no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them. The other two are in Africa,\" he said. That stat stopped us cold, and not just because we’re overdue for a long weekend off. Could Grayson be right that the United States is one of the only countries in the entire world that doesn’t grant a legal right to paid time off? Well, not exactly; Grayson’s campaign admitted he had misspoken. But available research shows he’s not far off the mark by suggesting that America is unique by not guaranteeing vacation time. Zero guarantee Grayson campaign spokesman David Damron told us via email that the Orlando Democrat meant to say only a handful of island nations in the Pacific Ocean joined the United States in not guaranteeing paid time off — not two countries in Africa. Those five countries, according to Wikipedia, were Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and Nauru, he said. \"The congressman accidentally conflated guaranteed paid vacation and paid sick time in his recollection of which countries fell into this category of weak worker protections with the United States, which was the basis for his reference to Africa (rather than the Pacific),\" Damron wrote. We don’t take Wikipedia’s word as gospel, of course, but we could not get experts to speak to specific conditions in those five countries. Together, they have a population of around 300,000 — or about the population of Pittsburgh. The biggest repository of trusted data we found came from UCLA’s World Policy Analysis Center. Their database showed 13 countries, including the United States, with no guaranteed paid annual leave. Their list did include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru, but also larger countries like Pakistan and India. Now, sometimes leave varies by how long a worker is at a job or some other classification. The World Policy Analysis Center’s database notes they \"report the lowest amount of leave guaranteed to a worker with at least one year of tenure.\" The World Bank has its own detailed numbers for vacation available to workers based on tenure. The bank measured paid annual leave for 189 economies, including splitting some countries into large metro areas. The United States, for example, is split into New York and Los Angeles. The bank’s table did list five Pacific island nations that did not guarantee paid leave time for any workers with one or more years of service: The Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Palau and Tonga. It didn’t have data for Nauru, where unemployment among its 10,000 or so residents hovered around 90 percent in 2004. If it sounds to you like those aren’t the kind of countries normally associated with a global economic powerhouse like the United States, you’d be right. Most studies on this issue stuck to smaller sets of much more comparable nations. These usually involved grouping countries with words like \"developed\" or \"rich.\" For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries, notes that in 2014 the United States was its only member country with no statutory minimum of paid days off. A 2011 Business Insider roundup using data from global human resources firm Mercer said 39 developed countries offered more vacation time than the United States. Mercer’s Worldwide Benefit and Employment Guidelines, last updated in 2015, tracks 74 countries across the planet (the Pacific island nations Damron cited are absent). It notes the United States ranks the lowest among the surveyed countries with no \"statutory holiday entitlement.\" Often cited in media reports is the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s 2013 study, No-Vacation Nation Revisited. That paper compared paid vacation and paid holidays in 21 countries with advanced economies: 16 in Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. France led the pack with 30 paid vacation days. While the French get one paid holiday, Austrians get 13, plus 25 vacation days. The United Kingdom offers 28 vacation days. But almost every country in the CEPR study had more than 20 paid vacation days, except Canada and Japan, which only awarded 10. America came in dead last in guaranteed time off, with a grand total of zero days. Many employers do offer paid vacation and holidays, but there’s no law that says they must. And businesses do take advantage of the fact. \"In the absence of a legal requirement for paid vacation and paid holidays, about one fourth of the U.S. workforce has no paid vacation or paid holidays in the course of their work year,\" the CEPR report read. \"The sum of the average paid vacation and paid holidays ― 16 in total ― offered in the private sector in the United States would not meet even the minimum required by law in 19 other rich countries analyzed here.\" Our ruling Grayson said, \"There\\'s only three countries in the entire world wherethere\\'s no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them.\" Grayson’s claim, taken literally, is incorrect. A Grayson spokesman said the congressman had fumbled his talking point a bit, especially the part about a pair of African nations being the other two. But the point he was trying to make to viewers and voters largely holds up. The United States is certainly one of just a few countries that does not guarantee paid vacation as a right, and an outlier among developed nations. In that sense, Grayson’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.',\n",

       " 'claim': 'Social media posts with pictures of gas prices and captions urging people to “Never forget January 6th” accurately documented the cost of fuel on the day of the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot.',\n",
       " 'doc': 'The gas prices pictured in two different shared pictures did not reflect the national average price for regular unleaded gasoline on Jan. 6, 2021. Further, reverse image searches found that both photographs were taken while former U.S. President Barack Obama was in his second term in the White House. On June 12, 2022, the Cullman Daily Facebook page, which is managed by a self-described “conservative and Christian news organization,” posted a picture of an Exxon gas station sign showing the price for regular unleaded fuel at $1.73 per gallon, with the caption, “We will never forget January 6th, 2021.” At the time that post was published, U.S. gas prices had just reached a record high of $5 a gallon. The “Never forget January 6th” Facebook post was created when a U.S. House panel was conducting televised hearings to lay out evidence about events leading up to the day of the U.S. Capitol riot. On that day, Jan. 6, 2021, 140 law enforcement officers were injured as a result of the actions of a mob of supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who lost the 2020 U.S. presidential election. According to CNBC,Capitol Police OfficerBrian Sicknickdied the day after the riot, and at least four other officers later died by suicide. As for the accuracy of the “Never forget January 6th” Facebook post, in reality, the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline on Jan. 6, 2021, was between $2.25 and $2.31, not $1.73, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Further, the photograph in the post was captured in Woodbridge, Virginia on Jan. 5, 2016, five years before the violence at the Capitol. At the time, former U.S. President Barack Obama was serving his second elected term in the White House. Future U.S. President Joe Biden was Obama’s vice president for both terms. (EIA numbers showed that the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline in early January 2016 was around $2.02 per gallon.) We also found that a second picture of gas prices was used to promote a “Never forget January 6th” message, again in reference to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The photograph in these posts was shared on Facebook and Twitter in June 2022: Never forget January 6th, 2021 pic.twitter.com/8J9Zmz6jcN However, again, this picture was somewhat misleading, both because of the prices displayed on the sign and the origins of the photograph. The picture was captured at a Citgo gas station in January 2015, also when Obama was president and Biden was vice president. (In January 2015, the national average for regular unleaded gasoline ranged between $2.04 and $2.21 per gallon.) In early 2020, when Trump still occupied the White House, gas prices fell due to a dramatic decrease in demand for gasoline following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Basically, fewer drivers on the road meant less gasoline purchased, which drove down costs. More than two years later, when U.S. President Joe Biden was in his second year in the White House, gas prices reached the aforementioned record high national average of $5 per gallon. The Associated Press reported that a variety of non-political factors were believed to have contributed to higher gas prices not just in the U.S., but around the world: Global oil prices have been rising — unevenly, but sharply overall — since December. The price of international crude has roughly doubled in that time, with the U.S. benchmark rising nearly as much … Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by the United States and its allies have contributed to the rise. Russia is a leading oil producer. The United States is the world’s largest oil producer, but U.S. capacity to turn oil into gasoline is down 900,000 barrels of oil per day since the end of 2019, according to the Energy Department. Tighter oil and gasoline supplies are hitting as energy consumption rises because of the economic recovery. The reporting also mentioned that the record high was likely reached in part due to demand for gasoline for all of the travelers who hit the road around the Memorial Day holiday. In sum, two pictures were making the rounds on social media with captions that read, “Never Forget January 6th.” Neither photograph accurately represented the national average gas price on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the Capitol riot. In fact, both pictures were captured years before, while Obama was president and Biden was vice president. Note: As of June 2022,more than 800 peoplehad been arrested for their alleged participation in the violent Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

diesel, means that anything transported on a truck, train or ship is affected. energy costs are a major contributor to the decades-high inflation numbers showing up, as prices for all manner of goods and services march higher. \"energy, in a way, is the tail wagging the dog here,\" bob mcnally, president at rapidan energy group, said wednesday on cnbc\\'s \"power lunch.\" \"diesel is really the economic fuel. it\\'s the lifeblood of the economy, transportation, power in some cases ... so it really is embedded in economic activity and it\\'s filtered through so many goods and services.\" demand destruction, or the level at which high prices influence consumer behavior, from surging fuel costs might not have set in yet on a wide scale, but the impacts are filtering throughout the economy. higher prices at the pump mean not only less spending money in consumers\\' pockets but also expanding costs for companies, some or all of which will later be passed along to consumers. target is one of the companies grappling with higher costs. shares of the store chain cratered 25% on wednesday  the single worst day since 1987  following target\\'s earnings results, during which it warned about inflationary pressures. \"we did not anticipate the rapid shifts we\\'ve seen over the last 60 days. we did not anticipate that transportation and freight costs would soar the way they have as fuel prices have risen to all-time highs,\" target ceo brian cornell said wednesday on the company\\'s quarterly earnings call. he told cnbc that higher fuel and diesel costs will be a roughly $1 billion incremental cost during the fiscal year and a \"significant increase that [target] didn\\'t anticipate.\"[Evidence]:18 janv. 2021  ... capitol for possible \"reconnaissance\" the day before
